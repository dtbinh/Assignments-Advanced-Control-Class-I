#  Experiments in Control System Laboratory

Here, I post the experiments I realized in the Advanced Control Class.

The experiments realized are:

  *  1 - Introduction to State-Space Representation using Matlab & Simulink
  *  2 - Pole placement design
  *  3 - DC Motor position using pole placement desing Part I 
  *  4 - DC Motor position using pole placement desing Part II - Using Real-Time Windows Target (RTWT) 
  *  5 - State Observer
